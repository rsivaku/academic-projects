Task:

Develop a function sumseries(N,K) that computes and returns the sum of the series: N + (N+1) + (N+2) +â€¦ (N+(K-1))

A call to sumseries(10, 5) should return 60

Develop a function sumrandseries(N,K) that computes K random numbers between N and N+K, including (N and N+K as possible random numbers) and returns their sum.

For example, a call to sumrandseries(10,5) returned 59. The random numbers generated in this case were 10, 13, 12, 10, 14.

Develop a function compareseries(N,K) that returns the difference sumseries(N,K) - sumrandseries(N,K).

A call to compareseries(10,5) returned 1 for the above scenario.

Then write a program that takes N and K as user input and calls the function compareseries(N,K) 4 times and and prints the values returned by it.
