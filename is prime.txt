Task:

Write a Python function isPrime(number) that determines if the integer argument number is prime or not. The function will return a boolean True or False. And then write a function firstPrime(K) that takes integer K as an argument and returns the lowest prime that is greater than or equal to K.

Example Output:

isPrime(1) should return False

isPrime(2) should return True

isPrime(20) should return False

firstPrime(2) should return 2

firstPrime(20) should return 23
