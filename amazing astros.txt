Task:

You have to write a function upAstros(refstring) that takes a string as a parameter. It returns the same string with the first occurrence of the substring ‘Astros’ replaced by the string ‘Amazing Astros’. If the substring ‘Astros’ does not exist, it returns the string unchanged.

For example:

upAstros("Yankees played Astros again")

will return: ‘Yankees played Amazing Astros again’

upAstros("Astros will play in Houston. Astros will win")

will return: ‘Amazing Astros will play in Houston. Astros will win’

def upAstros(refstring):
    newstring = ""
    x = refstring.find("Astros")
    
    # If Astros is located in refstring (if not, x = -1, and thus this if-block does not run)
    if x != -1:
        # Newstring has the refstring from the beginning to the index before "Astros" is present
        # Following that, 'Amazing' is added to the newstring
        # This is then followed by the refstring from the index including Astros all the way to the end
        newstring = newstring + refstring[0:x] + 'Amazing ' + refstring[x:]
        return newstring
    
    # If Astros is not present, then the string is returned as it was inputted
    else:
        return refstring

    
a = upAstros("Yankees played Astros again")
print(a)

b = upAstros("Astros will play in Houston. Astros will win")
print(b)

c = upAstros("This string does not have the keyword")
print(c)
