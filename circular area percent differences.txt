Task:

In this question, you will experimentally verify the sensitivity of using a precise Pi to the accuracy of computing the area of a circle. You need to perform the following activities with a Python program:

Ask the user to input a radius value. It may be an integer or a float.

Compute the area of a circle with that radius using Pi from the Python Math Library. Assign the area to a variable, say realA.

Now compute the area of the circle using the Pi value with precision 1,2, and 3 points after the decimal place. (i.e., Pi = 3.1, 3.14 & 3.141). Then print the percentage difference between each of the areas calculated using each of these values of Pi and realA.

Note: Difference is: [Area from Math Library] â€“ [Area you calculate with PI = 3.xxx]
