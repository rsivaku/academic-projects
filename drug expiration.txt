Task:

A drug loses decayrate percent of its potency every month. Also, a drug is considered expired if it loses more than 50% potency. Your goal is to write a function  WhenExpired(decayrate)  that returns the number of months after which the drug is considered expired.

Example 1: WhenExpired(20) should return 4

Example 2: WhenExpired(50) should return 2

def WhenExpired(decayrate):
    potency = 100
    months = 0
    
    #While potency is 50 or above, potency will be decreased each time by the decay rate.
    # For each month the drug survives, month is incremented by 1. Finally, the lifetime in months is returned and printed.
    while potency >= 50:
        potency = potency - potency * decayrate/100
        months = months + 1
    return months

a = WhenExpired(20)
print(a)

b = WhenExpired(50)
print(b)
