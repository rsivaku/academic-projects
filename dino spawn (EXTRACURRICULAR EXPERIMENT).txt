Task: (NOT A SCHOOL ASSIGNED PROJECT; DONE IN FREE-TIME AS AN EXPERIMENT)

Create a program that mimics a video game in spawning dinosaur AI. The program must take user input for each dinosaur species spawn density from a scale of 0-5. 
If the user enters 0, no dinosaurs of that species should spawn.

After taking user input, the program must let the user know how many of each dinosaur species spawned.

Additionally, the program must tell the user whether EACH individual dinosaur in each species is male or female

Finally, the program must tell the user the rarity of EACH individual dinosaur in each species AND tell the user which skin (texture) they are using.
